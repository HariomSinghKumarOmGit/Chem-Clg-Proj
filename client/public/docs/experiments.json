    "theory": "Titration is a quantitative analytical technique used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration (called the standard solution). In an acid-base titration, a known volume of an acid reacts with a base, or vice versa, according to a neutralization reaction. Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base to form salt and water.\n\nIn this experiment, hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, is titrated against sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, of known concentration. The reaction taking place is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nAs NaOH is added from the burette to the fixed volume of HCl in the conical flask, the acid is gradually neutralized. To detect the end point of the titration (the point at which the acid has been exactly neutralized by the base), an indicator is used. Phenolphthalein is chosen as the indicator because it is colorless in acidic solution and turns pink in slightly basic solution.\n\nAt the start, the HCl solution with phenolphthalein is colorless, indicating an acidic medium. As NaOH is added and the solution approaches neutrality, the color begins to change. The end point is reached when a faint permanent pale pink color appears and persists for about 30 seconds, showing that a slight excess of NaOH is present and the acid has been completely neutralized.\n\nBy accurately measuring the volume of NaOH used to reach this end point and knowing its concentration, the concentration of the HCl solution can be calculated using the titration formula:\n\nC₁V₁ = C₂V₂,\n\nwhere C₁ and V₁ are the concentration and volume of the acid, and C₂ and V₂ are the concentration and volume of the base. This allows us to determine the unknown concentration of the given acid solution.",
