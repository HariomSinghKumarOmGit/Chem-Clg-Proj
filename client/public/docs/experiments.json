    "theory": "Titration is a quantitative analytical technique used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration (called the standard solution). In an acid-base titration, a known volume of an acid reacts with a base, or vice versa, according to a neutralization reaction. Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base to form salt and water.\n\nIn this experiment, hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, is titrated against sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, of known concentration. The reaction taking place is:\n\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\nAs NaOH is added from the burette to the fixed volume of HCl in the conical flask, the acid is gradually neutralized. To detect the end point of the titration (the point at which the acid has been exactly neutralized by the base), an indicator is used. Phenolphthalein is chosen as the indicator because it is colorless in acidic solution and turns pink in slightly basic solution.\n\nAt the start, the HCl solution with phenolphthalein is colorless, indicating an acidic medium. As NaOH is added and the solution approaches neutrality, the color begins to change. The end point is reached when a faint permanent pale pink color appears and persists for about 30 seconds, showing that a slight excess of NaOH is present and the acid has been completely neutralized.\n\nBy accurately measuring the volume of NaOH used to reach this end point and knowing its concentration, the concentration of the HCl solution can be calculated using the titration formula:\n\nC₁V₁ = C₂V₂,\n\nwhere C₁ and V₁ are the concentration and volume of the acid, and C₂ and V₂ are the concentration and volume of the base. This allows us to determine the unknown concentration of the given acid solution.",

    "theory": "The enthalpy of combustion (ΔHc) is the heat energy released when one mole of a substance is completely burned in excess oxygen under standard conditions (298 K, 1 atm). Combustion reactions are typically exothermic, meaning they release heat to the surroundings. For organic compounds like ethanol, combustion involves the complete oxidation of carbon to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and hydrogen to water (H₂O).\n\nIn this experiment, the enthalpy change of combustion of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is determined using calorimetry. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethanol is:\n\nC₂H₅OH(l) + 3O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nWhen ethanol burns in the spirit burner, the chemical energy stored in its bonds is converted into heat energy, which is absorbed by the water in the copper can. As a result, the temperature of the water increases. The amount of heat absorbed by the water (q) can be calculated using the relationship:\n\nq = mcΔT\n\nwhere m is the mass of water (in grams), c is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 J g⁻¹ K⁻¹), and ΔT is the change in temperature of the water (T_final − T_initial). This heat is assumed to be equal in magnitude (but opposite in sign) to the heat released by the combustion of ethanol, ignoring heat losses to the surroundings.\n\nThe mass of ethanol burned is obtained by measuring the spirit burner (plus ethanol) before and after the experiment. From the mass burned and the molar mass of ethanol, the number of moles of ethanol combusted is calculated. The molar enthalpy of combustion (ΔHc, in kJ mol⁻¹) is then found by dividing the heat released by the number of moles of ethanol burned, and converting to kJ. Since combustion is exothermic, ΔHc is negative.\n\nBecause a simple calorimeter and open setup are used, some heat is lost to the surroundings, the burner, and the can. Therefore, the experimental value of ΔHc is usually less exothermic (less negative) than the accepted standard value.",

Oxalic acid (H₂C₂O₄) acts as the reducing agent. In acidic medium, the following overall balanced redox reaction takes place:\n\n2KMnO₄ + 5H₂C₂O₄ + 3H₂SO₄ → K₂SO₄ + 2MnSO₄ + 10CO₂ + 8H₂O\n\nIn acidic solution, MnO₄⁻ ions (purple) are reduced to Mn²⁺ ions (nearly colorless), while oxalic acid is oxidized to carbon dioxide gas. At the beginning of the titration, each drop of KMnO₄ added is immediately decolorized as it reacts with oxalic acid, so the solution remains almost colorless. As the endpoint approaches and the oxalic acid is nearly consumed, a slight excess of KMnO₄ added cannot be fully reduced and therefore imparts a faint permanent pink color to the solution.\n\nThe reaction between KMnO₄ and oxalic acid is relatively slow at room temperature, so the solution is warmed to about 60–70°C to increase the rate of reaction and obtain a sharp endpoint. In the presence of dilute sulfuric acid, the redox reaction proceeds smoothly, and the volumes of KMnO₄ used can be measured accurately.\n\nBy knowing the concentration and volume of KMnO₄ used at the endpoint and using the stoichiometric relationship from the balanced equation, the concentration of the oxalic acid solution can be calculated.",

Several factors affect the rate of reaction, including the concentration of reactants, temperature, surface area, and the presence of catalysts. According to collision theory, increasing the concentration of reactants increases the frequency of effective collisions, thereby increasing the reaction rate.\n\nIn this experiment, the reaction between sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is used to study how concentration affects the rate of reaction. The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nNa₂S₂O₃(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + SO₂(g) + S(s) + H₂O(l)\n\nDuring the reaction, sulfur dioxide gas (SO₂) and solid sulfur (S) are produced. The sulfur formed appears as a fine yellow precipitate, which makes the solution increasingly cloudy. By placing a conical flask containing the reaction mixture over a piece of paper with a black cross, the progress of the reaction can be visually monitored. As more sulfur forms, the solution becomes opaque, and the cross eventually disappears from view.\n\nThe time taken for the cross to become invisible is used as a measure of the reaction time. The rate of reaction is then taken as the reciprocal of the time (rate ∝ 1/time). By performing the experiment with different concentrations of sodium thiosulfate while keeping the concentration and volume of HCl constant, the effect of concentration on the reaction rate can be observed.\n\nAccording to the general rate law concept, for this reaction the rate is expected to increase as the concentration of sodium thiosulfate increases, because more thiosulfate ions per unit volume lead to a greater frequency of effective collisions with H⁺ ions from HCl.",

Triglycerides are esters formed from glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol) and long-chain fatty acids. When a fat or oil is heated with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the ester bonds are broken, yielding glycerol and the sodium salts of the fatty acids. These sodium salts are the soap.\n\nThe general saponification reaction can be represented as:\n\nTriglyceride + 3NaOH → Glycerol + 3 Fatty acid salts (soap)\n\nFor example, a simplified equation for the saponification of a triglyceride containing stearic acid residues is:\n\nC₃H₅(C₁₇H₃₅COO)₃ + 3NaOH → 3C₁₇H₃₅COONa + C₃H₅(OH)₃\n\nSoaps are anionic surfactants. Each soap molecule has a long non-polar hydrocarbon tail (hydrophobic) and a polar carboxylate head group (hydrophilic). In water, soap molecules arrange themselves into micelles, where the hydrophobic tails dissolve grease and oil, and the hydrophilic heads interact with water. This allows soap to emulsify oils and remove dirt from surfaces and skin.\n\nIn the experimental procedure, vegetable oil serves as the triglyceride source. Sodium hydroxide solution provides the hydroxide ions required for ester hydrolysis. Ethanol is added to help dissolve the oil and improve mixing. Heating the mixture increases the reaction rate and ensures complete saponification. After the reaction, a saturated sodium chloride solution is added to 'salt out' the soap. The presence of excess ions reduces the solubility of the soap in water, causing it to precipitate and allowing it to be filtered off and washed.\n\nThe final dried product can be examined for properties such as hardness, lathering ability, and texture, which depend on the type of oil and the reaction conditions.",

      "theory": "pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution and is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration:\n\npH = −log[H⁺]\n\nAcidic solutions have pH values less than 7, neutral solutions have pH 7, and basic (alkaline) solutions have pH values greater than 7. Strong acids and bases ionize almost completely in water, giving very low or very high pH values, while weak acids and bases partially ionize and have pH values closer to 7.\n\nIndicators are substances that change color depending on the pH of the solution. A universal indicator is a carefully formulated mixture of several pH indicators that produces a broad range of colors over the entire pH scale, typically from pH 1 to 14. Each color corresponds to a specific pH value or narrow pH range, which can be matched to a pH color chart.\n\nIn this experiment, a few drops of universal indicator are added to various household and laboratory solutions such as lemon juice, vinegar, tap water, baking soda solution, soap solution, NaOH, and HCl. The resulting color in each test tube is compared with the pH color chart to estimate the pH of the solution. From these values, the nature of each solution (strong acid, weak acid, neutral, weak base, or strong base) can be identified.\n\nBy arranging the tested solutions in order from lowest to highest pH, a practical pH scale diagram can be constructed. This provides a visual understanding of the relative acidity or basicity of common substances and illustrates the continuous nature of the pH scale.",
